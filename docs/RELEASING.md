# Release Process

This document describes the release process for kirocc.

## Overview

kirocc uses [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) for automated releases. When a version tag is pushed, GitHub Actions automatically builds multi-platform binaries, publishes them to GitHub Releases, and updates the Homebrew tap.

## Prerequisites

- Write access to the repository
- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated

## Quick Release (via Claude Code)

```bash
/release v0.1.0
```

The `/release` skill guides you through the full process interactively.

## Manual Release Steps

### 1. Update main branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Create release branch

```bash
git checkout -b release/v0.0.X
```

### 3. Create release notes

Create `docs/release-notes/v0.0.X.md` following this template:

```markdown
# Release v0.0.X

#### Contributors section

List external contributors (non-maintainer) who authored PRs included in this release. Bot accounts should be excluded.

```bash
gh pr list --state merged --search "merged:>YYYY-MM-DD" \
  --json number,title,author \
  --jq '.[] | select(.author.login != "d-kuro" and (.author.login | test("\\[bot\\]$") | not)) | "- @\(.author.login) (#\(.number))"'
```

If there are no external contributors, omit the Contributors section entirely.

### 4. Commit and push

```bash
git add docs/release-notes/v0.0.X.md
git commit -m "docs: add release notes for v0.0.X"
git push -u origin release/v0.0.X
```

### 5. Create and merge PR

```bash
gh pr create --title "Release v0.0.X" --body "Release v0.0.X

See [docs/release-notes/v0.0.X.md](docs/release-notes/v0.0.X.md) for details."
```

Merge the PR after CI passes.

### 6. Create and push tag

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag v0.0.X
git push origin v0.0.X
```

### 7. Update GitHub Release notes

After GoReleaser creates the release, sync the release notes:

```bash
gh release edit v0.0.X --notes-file docs/release-notes/v0.0.X.md
```

## Automated Release Process

When a tag is pushed, the following happens automatically:

1. **ci job** — Runs lint and tests
2. **release job** — Builds and publishes (after ci passes)
   - Builds binaries for macOS and Linux (amd64, arm64)
   - Creates tar.gz archives
   - Publishes to GitHub Releases
   - Updates Homebrew cask in `d-kuro/homebrew-tap`

## Version Scheme

kirocc follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and documentation
